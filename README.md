**CarmenCarreno/carmencarreno** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I currently study the 7th semester of Biomedical Engineering at Universidad AutÃ³noma de QuerÃ©taro (UAQ), which I would say is full-time work. Iâ€™m working on my thesis which owe is to develop a way to diagnose breast cancer.

Barely have I free time to do other things out of university, but what I like is to learn about everything. Iâ€™ve been studying french for two years know and itâ€™s become my passion, and I also really love Biology so I like to read a lot about it, specially Neurology, and I enjoy to attend some congresses and symposiums.

Because of my career, there are a lot of topics I am interested atâ€¦ Nanotechnolgy, Administration and Technolgy Management, Artificial Intelligence and, Image and Signal Processing.

I like photography, not professionally but spontaneously.
